# The rise of E-commerce - Retail Sales in the USA (Q4 1999 - Q1 2020)

The way we consume goods and services has evolved quite drastically since we've entered the "digital age".

How has e-commerce developed over the years?
* Is there there any pattern in the variations of e-commerce sales?
* Can we predict how this type of sales evolves?
* What is the share of E-commerce Retail Sales in the Total Sales?
* Has its share grown faster than Total Sales?
* Can we predict the share of E-commerce Retail Sales as a Percent of Total Sales?

For this project, we study data from the Federal Bank of Saint Louis, USA:
* E-Commerce Retail Sales (ECOMNSA)
* E-Commerce Retail Sales as a Percent of Total Sales (ECOMPCTNSA)

E-Commerce Retail Sales is a measure of U.S. "sales of goods and services where the buyer places an order, or the price and terms of the sale are negotiated over an Internet, mobile device (M-commerce), extranet, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network, electronic mail, or other comparable online system. Payment may or may not be made online."
